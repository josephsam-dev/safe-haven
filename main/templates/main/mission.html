      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Safe Haven exists to provide a safe, inclusive, and empowering space for
        single mothers, single fathers, couples, and families affected by trauma,
        conflict, abuse, and emotional distress.
      </p>
      <p>
        We operate beyond religious ideology and are open to everyone, regardless
        of faith, belief, culture, background, or identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we do not encourage divorce, we believe that with proper care,
        professional guidance, and community support, many families can heal,
        rebuild trust, and grow stronger.
